            <!-- Information about the band-->
                <p>Hop Along is an American indie folk-rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.It first started out as a solo act made by Frances Quinlan.Three years after her first album, Quinlan's brother Mark joined the project as drummer, followed by bassist Tyler Long in 2009.The orginal name, Queen Ansleis, was shortened, possibly to better reflect the change from solo project to full band. Hop Along went on to release an EP, Wretches, in 2009, and a full-length LP entitled Get Disowned on May 5, 2012, winning a highly positive critical response from the independent music press.In October 2014, Hop Along signed to indie rock label Saddle Creek Records, which released the band's third full-length record, Painted Shut, on May 4, 2015. </p>
